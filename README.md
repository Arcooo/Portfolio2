# ALEC JAMES'S DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO 
 
### Purpose

My name is Alec James and I am a recent Clark University MBA graduate. I would like to get my foot in the door of data analytics professionally. The technical skills required of data analysts in the job market that I have seen are: 
- Python or R
- SQL and relational database management
- Excel aka the bread and butter of data analysis
- Statistics

I hope to demonstrate my technical skills through my projects. I also wish to demonstrate my ability to communicate clearly through my notes, comments, and general organization.
