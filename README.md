# ALEC JAMES'S DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO 
 
### Purpose

My name is Alec James and I am a recent Clark University MBA graduate. I would like to get my foot in the door of data analytics professionally. The technical skills required of data analysts in the job market that I have seen are: 
- Python or R
- SQL and relational database management
- Excel aka the bread and butter of data analysis
- Statistics

I hope to demonstrate my technical skills through my projects. I also wish to demonstrate my ability to communicate clearly through my notes, comments, and general organization.

### Projects in the Portfolio
- [ ] [Wayfair Data Science Competition]()
> 
- [ ] [NFL 2019 SQL Demonstration Project with Web Scraping]()
>
- [ ] [Coding Interview Questions]()
>
- [ ] [Useful Code Bits and Scripts]()
>



### My Programming
I am a huge fan of Python notebooks for coding. I think that Jupyter Notebooks are visually appealing and a smooth environemnt to program in. Don't be afraid to click on the .ipnyb files as, being a public portfolio, I will try to explain my code in markdown as best I can. Also, to make this portfolio more understandable, I will utilize README.md for the files in the folder structure. 

I also use VS Code mainly to do live peer programming using the *Live Share* extensions which is very cool.
