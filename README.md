##Purpose

My name is Alec James and I am a recent Clark University MBA graduate. I would like to get my foot in the door of data analytics professionally. The skills required of data analysts in the job market that I have seen are: Python and ability to clean, visualize, predict, and draw insights, SQL and the understanding of relational databases, and excel and statistics.
